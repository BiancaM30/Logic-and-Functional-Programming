# Logic-and-Functional-Programming

This repository contains solutions to problems in **LISP** and **Prolog**, focused on logic programming and functional paradigms. The problems include recursive functions, list manipulation, tree structures, and working with sets.

## Folder Structure

- **LISP**: Contains solutions to various recursive programming problems using the LISP language.
- **Prolog**: Contains solutions to logic programming problems using the Prolog language.

## LISP

### Lab 1: List and Atom Manipulation

1. **Problem 1:**
   - Insert a given atom after the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., element in a list.
   - Define a function to reverse a list of atoms at any level.
   - Define a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of numbers in a non-linear list.
   - Define a function that counts the occurrences of a given atom in a non-linear list.

2. **Problem 8:**
   - Remove the element at the n-th position in a list.
   - Define a function to determine the successor of a number represented as a list of digits.
   - Construct the set of atoms in a list.
   - Write a function that checks if a linear list is a set.

### Lab 2: Recursive Programming with Binary Trees

1. **Problem 13:**
   - Given a binary tree, print the path from the root to a given node `x`.

### Lab 3: Tree Operations

1. **Problem 10:**
   - Define a function to determine the number of nodes at level `k` in an `n-ary` tree.

## Prolog

### Lab 1: Set and Pair Operations

1. **Problem 7:**
   - Write a predicate that returns the union of two sets.
   - Write a predicate that returns all pairs of elements from a list.

### Lab 2: Sum Operations

1. **Problem 1:**
   - Define a predicate that determines the sum of two numbers written as lists.
   - Calculate the sum of all numbers represented by sublists in a heterogeneous list.

### Lab 3: Consecutive Sum Decomposition

1. **Problem 15:**
   - Given a positive number `n`, determine all its decompositions as a sum of consecutive natural numbers.

## Getting Started

1. **LISP**: To run the LISP code, use a LISP interpreter like SBCL or CLISP. Execute the `.lisp` files to test the functions.
2. **Prolog**: To run the Prolog code, use a Prolog interpreter like SWI-Prolog. Load the `.pl` files into the interpreter to test the predicates.
